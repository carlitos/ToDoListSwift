Ready? Let's go!

1. Create a TODO list app with the following fields
	- Content
	- Last modified date
	- Status (Completed|Pending)
	- Image (Optional)

2. iOS7 handheld is required. Tablet is a bonus.

3. As a user I should have a way to see at least 2 lists order by how recent the TODO was created/modified:
	- My pending TODOs
	- My completed TODOs

4. As a user I should be able to create a new TODO. All created tasks are marked as pending.

5. As a user I should be able to see when my task was modified in a human readable format.

6. As a user I should be able to edit a TODO.

7. As a user I should be able to search on each of my lists.

8. As a user I should be able to completed a task and it should be moved from one list the other.

9. As a user I should be able to share a TODO task. At least email and SMS is required, FB and TW are a bonus.

10. As a user I should be able to close the app and open it again without losing any TODO tasks.

11. As a user I should be able to add an image to each task, either from the gallery or directly from the camera. 

12. As a user I should be able to see if there is an image displayed as a thumbnail in my list and a way to see the full image in a separate screen.

Tips: 
1. If you have time add icons and/or make it as intuitive as possible.
2. What would you add to make it a hit on the AppStore?
3. Feel free to use reusable libraries, cocoapods or App Singletons if you think is worth it.

Good Luck!
